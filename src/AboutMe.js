    Hello! My name is Dante Miller, and I developed an interest in machine learning and data science during my time at the University of Minnesota - Morris. It all began when I took an introductory data mining course during my sophomore year, and I continued to pursue statistics and computer science courses while participating in various research projects over the years. Recently, I worked as a research intern at the Air Force Research Laboratory, where I gained exposure to natural language processing, argumentation generation and rule generation concepts in the context of patient data and medical sources. This experience sparked my interest in applying machine learning to medical data.

I am currently a first-year doctoral student in computer science at Rice University, and while I am still exploring potential research interests, I am particularly drawn to the field of medical informatics. I believe that by applying data science and machine learning techniques to healthcare data, we can improve healthcare outcomes, enhance patient safety, and elevate the overall quality of care.
