      Hi! My name is Dante Miller. I began my journey in machine learning and data science at my undergraduate institution, the University of Minnesota - Morris, after taking an introduction to data mining course in my sophomore year. Throughout the years, I would take statistics and computer science courses while involving myself in numerous research projects, allowing me to learn about and apply various machine learning, data engineering, and data science concepts. My most recent research experience was spent as a research intern at the Air Force Research Laboratory where I was able to learn about natural language processing, argumentation generation, and rule generation concepts. I am now a first-year doctorate student in computer science at Rice University with a potential research interest in computational biology.
